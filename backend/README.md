--version 1--- description
    1. It is an online service that matches customers with local professionals.
2. Get free cost estimates.
3. Customers see search results in real-time with profiles, ratings, and more. They can then filter the results to find the pros who are a good match.
You can start appearing in search results after doing two things:  
 i. Getting at least one review from a past customer.
ii. Setting up targeting preferences to help us match you with the right customers.

4. Professionals can also search for customers:
You tell us which customers you want to work with by setting targeting preferences. Preferences include things like where and when you work and the types of jobs you want to do. Be sure to set your preferences so you show up in search results.
5. Respond quickly and get hired.
After you get a lead and the customer starts a conversation with you, itâ€™s up to you to win the job. Review the job details and reply quickly. The faster you respond, the better your chances of getting hired.
6. Some categories:
Home Improvement, Wellness, Pets, Business, Events, Lessons, Maids, Crafts, Construction, UI/UX and Graphic Design, Web, Mobile App and Software Development, Legal, Personal, Photography, Repair and technical support, Writing, translation, and transcription, Vehicle services.
7. Both professionals and customers begin on Free Trial version for 10 days and after wards they should choose the type of subscription they see fit.
8. Payment is done through credit cards, paypal, and payfast. There is a currency changer via geolocation. Different currencies like USD, rands, pula, etc.

I left out that customers get quotes from professionals as many as the professionals can send but depending with the subscription they're using. Meaning there is a feature for professionals to create and send quotes. Quotes come via email or the customer can access via his dashboard. Remember both professionals and customers cant view each other emails or contacts
